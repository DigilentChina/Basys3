# Basys3 Github 
This repository provides Digital Design Libraries and Projects targeting the [Xilinx University Program (XUP) **Basys3 board** from Digilent](www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,1288&Prod=BASYS3).


The board features an Artix series 7 Xilinx FPGA and is an ideal platform for low cost teaching and student projects.
For questions, please contact the [Xilinx University Program](mailto:xup@xilinx.com).

### XUP_LIB and 74LSXX
There are two digital libraries that include basic logic blocks for schematic entry and teaching basic logic design; XUP_LIB (AND, OR, NOT, XOR etc) and 74LSXX models. 
These libraries include IP blocks are intended for classroom teaching and can be used with the Vivado IP integrator graphical environment to design, simulate and build designs for Xilinx FPGAs using schematics.
