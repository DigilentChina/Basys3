# Basys3 Github 
This repository provides Digital Design Libraries and Projects targeting the [Xilinx University Program (XUP) **Basys3 board** from Digilent](www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,1288&Prod=BASYS3).


The board features an Artix series 7 Xilinx FPGA and is an ideal platform for low cost teaching and student projects.
For questions, please contact the [Xilinx University Program](mailto:xup@xilinx.com).

### Basys3 Board Files
You may download the Basys3 board files zip file from here and extract it in the **\<Vivado_install_directory>\2014.4\data\boards\board_parts\artix7** directory. This will enable the board entry to be listed during the project creation step in Vivado and also use it in the Tcl script.


### XUP_LIB and 74LSXX
There are two digital libraries that include basic logic blocks for schematic entry and teaching basic logic design; XUP_LIB (AND, OR, NOT, XOR etc) and 74LSXX models. 
These libraries include IP blocks are intended for classroom teaching and can be used with the Vivado IP integrator graphical environment to design, simulate and build designs for Xilinx FPGAs using schematics.
